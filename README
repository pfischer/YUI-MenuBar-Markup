NAME
    YUI::Menu::Markup - Generate YUI markup menus

DESCRIPTION
    YUI::Menu::Markup will help you create your YUI menus by using markup
    (html).

    It offers a very light interface to create your modules from any kind of
    data, like *perl raw* (hashes) to even YAML.

    There are no plans in giving support for creating YUI menus by
    javascript data. Even, the html genearated doesn't allow modifications
    such as changing the CSS class name of the items.

Attributes
    source_class
        If you have your own class (or module) for getting the data of the
        menu please use this attribute. It should be the module name
        (*Foo::Bar*) and have the module should have a *new()* method.

        If your module doesn't have anything of the above please take a look
        to source_ref.

    source_ref
        Similar to source_class but it should be the reference (eg, the
        object) to the source.

        The class contained in this refernece should have a method named
        get_source and should return an array of hashes to be used for
        building the menu.

    data
        The data that will be used for building the menu, should be an array
        of hashes where

Methods
